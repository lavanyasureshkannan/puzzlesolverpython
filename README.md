1. This is 15 puzzle solver with Breadthfirst Search algorithm method using python 
2. First, Import all the required libraries such as collecions and queue.
3. Run each cell individually.
4. create a class node to define the action and algorithm that need to be performed.
5. create a class puzzle which defines all the steps that need to be performed
6. develop a BreadthFirstSearch algorithm in which a visited list is created and appending it after the nodes are expanded.
7. The algorithm also works for various test cases by changing the initial and goalstate(last position)
