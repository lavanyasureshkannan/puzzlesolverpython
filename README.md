1. This is 15 puzzle solve Breadthfirst Search algorithm using python 
2. First, Import all the required libraries such as collecions and queue.
3. create a class node to define the action and algorithm that need to be performed.
4. create a class puzzle which defines all the steps that need to be performed
5. develop a BreadthFirstSearch algorithm in which a visited list is created and appending it after the nodes are expanded.
6. The algorithm also works for various test cases by changing the initial and goalstate(last position)
